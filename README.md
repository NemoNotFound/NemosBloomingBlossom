## Features
With Blooming Blossom you can spread the cherry blossom biome even easier now!Â 
Pink petals now generate randomly around the cherry blossom tree when growing, so you don't need to place them manually! Bone meal now also generates more pink petals

## Requirement
To use this mod, you have to add the Fabric API too

## Misc
You can add Blooming Blossom to your own modpack, I'd be happy about it!
I appreciate any constructive feedback, so leave your thoughts in the comments! :)
