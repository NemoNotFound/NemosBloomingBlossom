# Nemo's Blooming Blossom

## Description

Nemo's Blooming Blossom generates pink petals around cherry trees as they grow,     
and generates more petals when bone meal is used on grass in a cherry biome.        

It also generates leaves around oak, birch and dark oak trees.
Flowers can be obtained by using bone meal on them as well.
